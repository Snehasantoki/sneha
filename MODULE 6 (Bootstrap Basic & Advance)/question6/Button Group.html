    What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group? 
    
   ----> Button groups allow multiple buttons to be stacked together on a single line.
    This is useful when you want to place items like alignment buttons together.
    You can add on optional JavaScript radio and checkbox style behavior with Bootstrap Button Plugin.
    This class is used for a basic button group.
