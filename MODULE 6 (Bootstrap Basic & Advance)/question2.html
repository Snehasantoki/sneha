-Bootstrap Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap.
-Bootstrap Containers are very essential and basic building blocks of bootstrap that wrap a pages content.
-Containers are defined within the container class (.container). In other words, we can say that containers

-> Containers are used for many purposes such as 

    It requires use with the default grid system.
    To establish width for the layout to give web content.
    To provide responsive fixed behavior of any web project.
    To sets the content margin dealing with the responsive behavior of your layout.


    Bootstrap has the default class or predefined class is container & container-fluid class for  layout. 
    Basically, there are three types of container classes available in bootstrap:

    1. Default-Container: The default container uses 'container' class. It provides a responsive fixed-width container.

        Syntax:

        <div class="container">
        <!-- Content here -->
        </div>

    2. Responsive-Container: Responsive containers are responsive in nature. Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints.

        Syntax:

        <div class="container-sm">Wide for small breakpoint</div>
        <div class="container-md">Wide for medium breakpoint</div>
        <div class="container-lg">Wide for large breakpoint</div>
        <div class="container-xl">Wide for extra large breakpoint</div>
        <div class="container-xxl">Wide for extra large breakpoint</div>

    3. Fluid-Container: Fluid-container uses the 'container-fluid' class. It is used for a full-width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

        Syntax:
        
        <div class="fluid-container">
          <!-- Content here -->
        </div>
